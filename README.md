# Company Information Management Form

> A frontend coding challange from ProSpace

It's a simple company and office listing app. It records company's information and its offices. Built on React and used Redux for the state management (as stated in the requirements). For the CSS framework I used Tailwind CSS. And for the form component I utilized React Hook Form. I also set a simple Node.js + Express backend that deployed on a free hosting service.

## Tech Stacks

These are the stacks I used in this project:

- **Git** — Distributed version control system
  - **GitHub** — Provides hosting for software development and version control using Git
- **React** — JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Redux** — Predictable state container for JS apps
- **React Redux** — Official React binding for Redux
- **React Router** — Declarative routing for React
- **React Hook Form** — Simple React forms binding and validation

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install dependencies with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn
```

### Setup Environment Variables

We need to connect to the deployed backend. Edit the `.env` file as follows:

```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://[].railway.app
REACT_APP_SECRET=your-secret-code
```

### Run Development

```sh
yarn start
```
